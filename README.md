# 100DaysOfCodePythonProjects

Hi Visitor!

I'm on a trail of learning and practicing my knowledge on Python by committing myself to take up some projects everyday 
for the next 100 days. I have been taking guidance from Dr. Anglea Yu's
[100 Days of Code,](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and I'm loving it. I thank 
[Dr. Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) for her beautifully designed engaging course and resources that's 
keeping me hooked to this journey. I'm sharing these codes on my GitHub to track progress and ensure that I consistently
practice coding. 

About me? I'm a Software Engineer specialising on Data Visualisation. My goal is to curate stories with existing
processed data, but I don't intent to stop there. I came to understand that there might not always be pre-processed 
data available at all times. So, I'm picking up some skills to extract and process data on the way. I want to progress 
as an individual contributor by collaborating with the rest of the world. I hope that one day really soon I'll be part 
of an open source product that will help visualise any sort of data and enlighten users with colourful insights. 

Here I go! Every day is a learning now. This is a huge leap of faith, and I'm proud and excited to take it.
